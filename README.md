# Paper title

This readme file is an outcome of the [CENG501 (Spring 2021)](http://kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~sinan/DL/) project for reproducing a paper without an implementation. See [CENG501 (Spring 2021) Project List](https://github.com/sinankalkan/CENG501-Spring2021) for a complete list of all paper reproduction projects.

# 1. Introduction

This repository is the implementation of the CVPR 2020 paper written by Deen Dayal Mohan et al. Please refer to [the paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Mohan_Moving_in_the_Right_Direction_A_Regularization_for_Deep_Metric_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) for a detailed explanation. Moving in Right Direction (MVR) paper tries to solve the metric learning problem, which aims to construct embedding space where distance is inversely correlated with semantic similarity. Metric learning has many practical applications such as image retrieval, face verification, person re-identification, few-shot learning, etc. Image retrieval aims to bring samples as same class as the given query image. MVR paper introduces direction regularization to prevent the unaware movement of samples. Therefore, their methodology improves the performance of retrieval tasks compared to a method without regularization. During this repository, we aim to quantitatively validate retrieval performance increases and visualize retrieval results to see the capability of deep metric learning.
